The goal of this project is to render three donut charts, using D3 library.
The architecture uses MVC pattern, having one single view consuming three different models.

- Open index.html in a browser to see the charts working.

## Build

- Open a terminal in the main folder.
- Run `gulp default`
- Open index.html in a browser to see the changes.

## Watch mode

No need to rebuild after code changes

- Open a terminal in the main folder.
- Run `gulp watch`
- Refresh index.html in the browser to see the changes.

## Run tests

## Improvements to be done

- Use of SCSS.
- Styled components instead of global.
